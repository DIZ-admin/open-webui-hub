# üìã Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## üìñ About ADRs

Architectural Decision Records document the significant architectural decisions made during the development of Open WebUI Hub. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of important choices.

## üéØ ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The architectural problem or decision needed
- **Decision**: What was decided and why
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral outcomes

## üìö Decision Records

### Infrastructure Decisions
- [ADR-001: Microservices Architecture](001-microservices-architecture.md)
- [ADR-002: Docker Containerization](002-docker-containerization.md)
- [ADR-003: PostgreSQL as Primary Database](003-postgresql-database.md)

### AI/ML Decisions
- [ADR-004: Ollama for Local LLM Inference](004-ollama-local-llm.md)
- [ADR-005: LiteLLM as API Proxy](005-litellm-api-proxy.md)
- [ADR-006: pgvector for Vector Storage](006-pgvector-embeddings.md)

### Development Decisions
- [ADR-007: Python Flask for API](007-python-flask-api.md)
- [ADR-008: Docker Compose for Orchestration](008-docker-compose-orchestration.md)

## üîÑ ADR Lifecycle

### Creating New ADRs
1. **Identify Decision**: Major architectural choice needed
2. **Research Options**: Investigate alternatives
3. **Draft ADR**: Use the template format
4. **Review Process**: Team discussion and feedback
5. **Accept Decision**: Mark as accepted and implement

### Updating ADRs
- **Deprecated**: Mark when decision is no longer valid
- **Superseded**: Reference newer ADR that replaces it
- **Historical Value**: Keep for understanding past decisions

## üìù ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Decision Title

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [List of decision makers]

## Context
Describe the architectural problem or decision that needs to be made.

## Decision
The decision that was made and why.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

### Negative  
- Trade-off 1
- Trade-off 2

### Neutral
- Neutral consequence 1

## Alternatives Considered
- **Alternative 1**: Brief description and why it was rejected
- **Alternative 2**: Brief description and why it was rejected

## Related Decisions
- [ADR-XXX](xxx-title.md) - Related decision
- [ADR-YYY](yyy-title.md) - Superseded by this decision
```

## üéØ Creating New ADRs

### When to Create an ADR
- **Significant architectural decisions** that affect multiple components
- **Technology choices** with long-term implications
- **Trade-offs** between competing approaches
- **Changes** to existing architectural decisions

### ADR Numbering
- Use sequential numbering: ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.
- Number is permanent even if ADR is deprecated
- Include number in filename for easy reference
